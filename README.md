# ml-lesson-quick-start
A lesson plan from 2017-2018 that walks students through beginning python, inferential statistics in python, and finally building a DNN using their own datasets.

The files here are a lesson plan developed in Spring 2017 and updated in Sprint 2018 to introduce students to topics 
in machine learning. This lesson plan is the most executive of over-views, and hopes to help students understand the
basic concepts in machine learning, while avoiding some of the requisite math that one must learn in order to truly
work in ml.

The use of these plans without permission is prohibited by the instructor--Zachary Rosen.
